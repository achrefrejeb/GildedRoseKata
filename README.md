# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/#!/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).
I think this kata
is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that.
